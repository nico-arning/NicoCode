accession: "20250106_PicassoXBridge_lysate_fullservice"  #Folder in the datapon
plate_format: 96 # How many wells per plate
read_pooling: "Treatment_plate1,Treatment_plate2,Treatment_plate3,Treatment_plate4,Treatment_plate5,Treatment_plate6" # Prefix to use as regex for read files. Here for examples the reads are names Treatment_plate_1_R1.fastq.gz & Treatment_plate_1_R2.fastq.gz, etc. Corresponds to the sheets on the metadata file
treatment_sheets: "Treatment_plate1,Treatment_plate2,Treatment_plate3,Treatment_plate4,Treatment_plate5,Treatment_plate6" # Sheets in the metadata file that contain the treatment information for each plate. Must correspond to the read_pooling in order
concentration_sheets: "concentration_plate1,concentration_plate2,concentration_plate3,concentration_plate4,concentration_plate5,concentration_plate6" # Same as treatment_sheets, but for the concentration information
barcode_setup: "alithea_kit.sh" # Barcode setup file, used for STAR. Contains information on which barcodes and where they start and end in the red

genome: "" # Leave empty if there is just one genome in the order
trim_mode: 1 # different rates of trimming. 1 is the default which is no trimming. No trimming needed for STAR

meta_data: "full_raw_matrix_and_meta.csv" # This is the name of the excel metadata file inside the MetaData folder in the experiment folder in Datapond. If you already have a count table (in the case of alithea full service), you can specify that here and the pipeline will start from the count table with DeSeq2
